Carriers set up with a non-bonded carrier code must have freight coming into Canada released at the border (first port of arrival), whereas bonded carriers have the privilege of moving unreleased goods In Bond to a bonded warehouse to await release there, or to move goods in transit through Canada, i.e. using Canada as a shortcut. To apply for a bonded carrier code the carrier must post security with CBSA. Carrier codes are issued and maintained by CBSA. Carriers can apply for a carrier code by filling out the application which can be found on CBSA's website. For carriers crossing the border into Canada, the carrier code is required to be the beginning of the conveyance reference number (trip number) of their ACI eManifest, as well as the beginning of any Cargo Control Number being used to identify freight.",
